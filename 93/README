Anthony's Editor July 93
========================

WHAT'S NEW since AE April 93

   o	Add recognition of ETCDIR environment variable as another
	possible location for the configuration file.  This should
	be initial set in a system .profile in case some users 
	neglect to provide their own editor configuration.

The original AE, in its obfuscated form, won "Best Utility" in the
1991 International Obfuscated C Code Contest.  Since that contest, AE
has been revised and extended in order to try new ideas and provide
better functionality, while still retaining a simple interface and
modualar design.

The distribution composes of several files.  Below is a list of the 
files in this distribution:

	readme		This file.
	ae.man		Manual reference and installation guide.
	copying		Public License

	makefile        Source makefile suitable for Make or AM.
	command.c	AE source. 
	data.c		    "
	display.c	    "
	gap.c		    "
	key.c		    "
	main.c		    "
	header.h	    "
	key.h		    "
	
	mode.rc		Sample configuration file modual style. 
	modeless.rc	Sample configuration file modeless style (ansi keys).

AE merges two schools of thought by providing both VI style (modual)
and EMACS style (modeless) editing interfaces.  Users can configure the
command-key bindings and the help text for either style.

AE is simple enough that anyone can modify it to add features.  The
source is free.  People are welcome to use and modify personal copies
(see the "copying" file for more details).

e.g.
	o  Tutorials on the Buffer Gap Scheme and/or editor design.
	o  A basis for an editor that can be built into a project.
	o  An editor for novice users.

AE has been know to compile on a wide variety of machines and compilers
like BSD and System V Unix with GNU C, PC mahcines with WatCom C or Turbo C,
and ATARI ST machines with Sozobon C.  Any machine that provides at least 
K&R C and a CURSES library should have no trouble getting AE to compile.

See the INSTALLATION section of the manual on how to build AE.  Also
take note of the BUG section of the manual.
